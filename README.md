# Laravel Package Development Skeleton Template

I decided to make my own repo for Laravel Package Development. In case that you want to use or reference, use this repo :D

## Guide
There will be some keywords in some files. You need to change it for your own cases.

### Keywords
- `:package`: your package name - follow by the naming rule of Composer
- `:namespace`: your package's main namespace
- `:facade`: your package main facade's name.

Change them before coding.

## What's next?
- Start to code
- Read the Laravel's documentation: [Package Development](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/packages) for more detail.

## Enjoy this and want to contribute something?
